# InSAR ChainProcessing

This repository is dedicated to the processing workflow for time series of SAR images.  This workflow enables the conversionof a time series of SAR images into a time series of interferograms. It consists of two main stages:  Pre-processing and Post-processing.  The Pre-processing stage involves transforming SAR images into interferograms,  while thePost-processing stage focuses on converting the outputs of our algorithms (in .npy format) into SAR-compatible formats, phase unwrapping, and estimating the time series of displacements.
